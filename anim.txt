Hi ! I'm Animessage, a command line application to create animated texts (such as ASCII art for example) in the terminal.
This tutorial will walk you through the creation of your first animessage in details. I recommend creating a folder named "tutorial" with 
a file named "tutorial.txt" in that folder, and to launch your default terminal on the side so you can follow along.
This tutorial is an animessage, with the only difference that it's embedded into Animessage instead of being written in a 
separate text file.
